# Risk
Risk (Prototype). This is a prototype of an unique idea of creating a system for Economic Education that understands internal relationships between different banks across the United States and design a metric that determines how failure in one can cause other banks to fail using factors like Counterparty Risk, Buyout, Texas Ration, etc. It uses Graph Theory and Predictive modeling to understand the banks on bank network created from available datasets.

This is just a prototyope of this idea and can be fully built if there is an access Y-14 dataset held by Federal Reserve System. But getting access to Y-14 requires permissions from Board members of FED Members and all.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Angular, Node js
